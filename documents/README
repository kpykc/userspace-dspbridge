Running Applications on DSP
===========================

To run an application on DSP one should have both bridgedriver and DSP
binaries.

To build bridgedriver, bridge api library and samples please refer to the
README document in each of those folders.

Once all binaries are build follow below steps to run sample applications.

1. Create a user specified directory in the linux target file system 
   e.g: /dspbridge
2. Copy bridge driver(bridgedriver.ko), utilities to install and uninstall 
   bridge driver( Scripts under mpu_driver/utils folder ) to the directory
   created.
3. Copy the bridge api libraies(libbridge.so, libbridge.so.2, libqos.a and
   libqos.so.2) to /lib folder of the target filesystem, make sure pthread
   libraries are part of the target filesystem.
4. Copy the sample binaries (srmcopy.out, ping.out dmmcopy.out,scale.out,
   cexec.out and zerocopymsg.out) to the directory created on target file
   system.
5. Copy DSP sample binaries (*.dof64P and *.dll64P ) from the samples folder
   (samples/dsp/samples )to the directory created on target file system. 
6. Load the sample dsp binary and start the image by running cexec.out 
   program. 
    # ./cexec.out ddspbase_tiomap3430.dof64P
7. On successful run the output displayed as: 
    DSP device detected !!
    DSPProcessor_Start succeeded.
    Hit any key to terminate cexec.
8. Run sample applications.
    e.g: 1. ./ping.out 10
         2. ./dmmcopy.out <inputfile> <outputfile>
         3. ./scale.out 10
         4. ./strmcopy.out <inputfile> <outputfile>
         5. ./zerocopymsg.out
		
For more information on samples functionality, refer to the DSP Bridge 
programming and reference guides.
