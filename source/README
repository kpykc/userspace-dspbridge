This is a quick readme regarding the build for userspace components
WARNING: This document is still a work in progress.

Section 0. Jump Start for the impatient:
----------------------------------------
make CROSS_COMPILE=<cross_compile_name>
Output will be in target directory
  target/
  |-- dspbridge (dspbridge test samples, prebuilt DSP components)
  `-- lib (Libbridge)


Section I. Pre-requisites:
-------------------------

a) PC: Linux machine - any latest PC with compilation environment is a
  must. it may work in other environments, but there are no guarentees
b) Compiler:
   i. ARM: http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm - 2007q3, 2008q3,
      2009q1 are known to work. This should be enough if you dont want
      to build DSP components and would like to use prebuilt stuff
   ii. DSP:
       CGT (Code Generation Tool): https://myportal.ti.com/portal/dt?provider=TIPassLoginSingleContainer&lt=myti&j5=2&j3=1&goto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-a.ti.com%3A443%2Fdownloads%2Fsds_support%2Ftargetcontent%2FLinuxDspTools%2Fdownload.html
	DSP/BIOS 5.33.04 package: https://myportal.ti.com/portal/dt?provider=TIPassLoginSingleContainer&lt=myti&j5=2&j3=1&goto=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-a.ti.com%3A443%2Fdownloads%2Fsds_support%2Ftargetcontent%2Fbios%2Findex.html
WARNING: this information might be outdates, confirm with the wiki page
above for the latest information

Section II. Make options for userpace repository
------------------------------------------------

Build is a standard gnumake system, there are few things to consider though:

a) Make variables:
=================
   Compiler selection:
     DEPOT - This points to the common directory off which cgt
             and dsp_bios are based off (Defaults: /opt/dsp)
     CROSS_COMPILE - this is the standard MPU cross compiler
	     (Default: arm-none-linux-gnueabi-).
	     for a native build, use CROSS_COMPILE=""

   Installation location tweaks:
     PREFIX - where do you want the installation of final files to go to?
              (Default: $PWD) - MUST be absolute path
     TDIR - where do you want the libdspbridge to go to?
             (Default: target) (Final result: $PREFIX/$TDIR)
     DDIR - where do you want the utilites, dsp libraries to go to?
             (Default: $PREFIX/$TDIR/dspbridge) (Final result: $PREFIX/$DDIR)

b) Build targets:
=================
    <none> OR all:
	Builds all mpu components including examples, copies prebuilt DSP bridge
	testing binaries.
	WARNING: these binaries have very basic functionality and cannot be used
	for multimedia development!

    clean:
	Cleanup the build

    mpu_build:
	Just build the samples and libbridge (no prebuilt binaries copied)

    dsp_build:
	Build the test samples

    predsp:
	Just copy the prebuilt binaries

    .api:
	Just build libbridge alone and install

    .samples:
	Just build the mpu side test samples alone

    .dsp:
	Just build the dsp components alone

Section III) Where do I get help/FAQs?
--------------------------------

Drop an email to http://groups.google.com/group/omapzoom

I want to read more. where do I go?
   http://omappedia.org/wiki/DSPBridge_Project

Where is the main userspace repository hosted?
   http://dev.omapzoom.org/?p=tidspbridge/userspace-dspbridge.git;a=summary

Do I need kernel changes for it?
   yes - DSPBridge is not mainlined to linux kernel

Which version of kernel should I use with this on OMAP3?
  See http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tmlind/linux-omap-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/dspbridge
  userspace stays in sync with this.
