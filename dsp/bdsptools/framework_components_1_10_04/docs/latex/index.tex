The Framework Components are made up of the following modules:\begin{itemize}
\item \hyperlink{group___d_s_p_d_s_k_t2}{ti.sdo.fc.dskt2} - x\-DAIS utility library for instantiating x\-DAIS algorithms, and managing their memory resources.\item \hyperlink{group___d_s_p_d_m_a_n3}{ti.sdo.fc.dman3} - DMA Manager library (Joule specific). A library for managing DMA hardware resources for x\-DAIS algorithms. This includes the \hyperlink{group___d_s_p_i_d_m_a3}{IDMA3 interface} (Joule specific), which x\-DAIS algorithms must implement to enable DMAN3 to manage their DMA resources.\item \hyperlink{group___d_s_p_a_c_p_y3}{ti.sdo.fc.acpy3} - High-Performance Functional DMA Interface and common library for OMAP2430, Da\-Vinci and Himalaya cores.\item \hyperlink{group___d_s_p_d_b_c}{ti.sdo.fc.utils} - Utilities which frameworks can built upon, including Design By Contract ({\tt DBC}) and Debug tracing tools ({\tt DBG}). \end{itemize}
