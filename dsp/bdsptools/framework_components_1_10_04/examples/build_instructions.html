<h1>Build Instructions for Framework Components Examples</h1>
<hr>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>This page explains how to build the examples provided in the
Framework Components (FC) product.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>See the release notes for the specific software and hardware components this
release of FC has been validated against.

<h2>Directory Conventions</h2>
<p><i>Important</i>: throughout the rest of this document, we will use the
following notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your FC
  installation.  The FC packages are in the
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory (or repository); the
  original examples are in the <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples</tt>
  directory (or repository).</li>
  <li><b><tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt></b> - the root directory of your
  xDAIS installation.  Some distributions of this FC release include an
  <b>fctools</b> directory which contains an xDAIS release.  In the case of
  those distributions, <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;</tt> could be set to
  <tt>&lt;FC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/fctools</tt>.  Note that the xDAIS packages will
  be located in the <tt>&lt;XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/packages</tt> directory
  (or repository).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing to Build the Examples</h2>
<h3>Create a working directory</h3>
<p>
Create a working directory (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages</b>) and copy the
<b>examples</b> directory into it (e.g. <b>c:/myPackages/examples</b>).
This will be where you build and modify the FC examples.
</p>
<p>
Doing this will ensure you have a backup copy of the original examples, as
provided by the FC product.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Build using the provided .pjt files</h2>
<p>There are 2 example applications provided in FC, davincisim_bios
and davincisim_nobios.  Each includes its own .pjt file located in
their respective directories.  <b>Note:</b>There is also a library
shared by both examples, which includes its own .pjt file
(fcpy_ti64.pjt).  Building either application will also build the
shared library.
</p>

<p>The .pjts require two variables to be
set, both are described above:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>XDAIS_INSTALL_DIR</tt> - required for the xDAIS interface headers</li>
  <li><tt>FC_INSTALL_DIR</tt> - required for the FC interface headers</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can either set these variables in your system, or modify the .pjt files
with paths appropriate for your development environment.
</p>
<p>
As expected, these .pjts require CCS and only run on Windows.  Also, the
.pjt's provided only support the C64+ target.
</p>
<p>
Note that these examples define <tt>IDMA3_USEFULLPACKAGEPATH</tt> in
their .pjt files.  See the release notes for more details.
