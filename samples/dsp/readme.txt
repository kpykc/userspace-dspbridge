Contents:  DSP/BIOS Bridge DSP-side examples.

Examples:
---------
strmcopy:       Task node, demonstrates GPP/DSP streaming.
ping:           Task node, demonstrates heartbeat messages to GPP from DSP.
scale:          Socket node

Notes:
-------

24xx samples differ from 1510 samples in that they have different node
libraries.  Phase libraries and dependent libraries are the same between
24xx and 1510.

See oak/src/samples for corresponding GPP console applications.
UUIDs (in oak/src/samples/<node>/<node>_uuid.h) must match UUID in .tcf files.
